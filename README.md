    - **Stock Ticker Symbol**: Input a single stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT).
    - **Return Type**: Choose between "Simple" or "Log (Continuously Compounded)" returns. This selection affects return calculations and subsequent analyses.
    - **Start Date & End Date**: Define the historical period for analysis.
    - **Seasonal Decomposition Period**: Set the period for seasonal decomposition (e.g., 30 for monthly data if daily prices).
    - **Decomposition Model**: Choose "Additive" or "Multiplicative".
    - **Rolling Volatility Window(s)**: Enter comma-separated day numbers for rolling volatility calculation (e.g., "30,60,90").
- **Run Analysis Button**: Fetches data and performs calculations.
- **Displayed Outputs**:
    - **Stock Closing Price**: Line chart of historical closing prices.
    - **Daily Returns**: Line chart of the selected type of daily returns.
    - **Return Distribution Statistics**:
        - **Skewness**: Measures the asymmetry of the return distribution.
        - **Excess Kurtosis (Fisher)**: Measures the 'tailedness' of the return distribution.
    - **Rolling Annualized Volatility**: Chart displaying the annualized rolling volatility for the specified window(s).
    - **ACF & PACF of Squared Returns**: Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation plots for squared returns, useful for identifying volatility clustering.
    - **Interactive Seasonal Decomposition**: Plots of observed, trend, seasonal, and residual components of the closing price.
    - **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test on Residuals**: Statistical test for stationarity of the decomposition residuals.
